YumList
==========


YumList allows you to pull your recipe lists in from [Yummly](http://yummly.com) and (soon) Pinterest and add photos and comments on what you have cooked.  This project came to life after time and time again making something from a recipe that I tweaked or had comments on or just wanted to take a picture of.  YumList aims to do that, so that you will never again forget that the recipe you made was just a little too salty, but otherwise delicious!

Setup
-----------------

I used CocoaPods to install some third-party libraries into the project.  Because the current release of CocoaPods lacks support for some Xcode 5 related features, you may have to run `bundle install` to fetch the latest version.   Just run `pod install` in the main directory after that, and open YumList.xcworkspace.
