WunderTest
==========


WunderTest is the test app I built for the fine folks at 6Wunderkinder!  I hope you guys like it!


Setup
===========

I used CocoaPods to install some third-party libraries into the project.  Because the current release of CocoaPods lacks support for some Xcode 5 related features, you may have to run `bundle install` to fetch the latest version.   Just run `pod install` in the main directory after that, and open WunderTest.xcodeworkspace.
